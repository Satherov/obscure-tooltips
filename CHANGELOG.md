This update focuses on accessibility and quality improvements for tooltips.
- Added **smooth scrolling** for tooltips that don't fit on screen.
- Added configurable **automatic line wrapping** for long tooltip lines.
- Added configurable inner tooltip **margin**.
- Fixed NBT filter logic; it now supports partial NBT matching.
- Added a config option for blacklisting specific items, allowing Obscure Tooltips to be fully disabled for them to avoid issues with certain incomplete or poorly implemented items from other mods. By default, this resolves compatibility with the **Quality Equipment** mod.

**Breaking change**: The config file has been expanded and restructured. Most of your previous settings will need to be transferred manually.
