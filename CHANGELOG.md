- Added a new **Identifier Filter** that allows filtering ID strings by `contains`/`starts_with`/`ends_with` – useful for bulk style application to materials.
- Fixed a startup crash related to Vibrant Tooltip hint injection.
- Fixed a render crash caused by incorrect TooltipState casting.
- Improved compatibility with mods that modify the tooltip component list before rendering.
